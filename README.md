Okay, I will combine the standard NestJS starter README content with the project-specific details for your NestJS & React Task Manager application that we discussed.

Here is the updated and combined `README.md` content:

## Description

This is a full-stack task management application built with a NestJS backend and a React frontend, demonstrating standard CRUD operations.

## Technologies Used

**Backend (NestJS)**

- NestJS
- TypeORM
- PostgreSQL
- TypeScript

**Frontend (React)**

- React
- Vite
- React Router DOM
- Axios
- Font Awesome
- CSS
- TypeScript (Optional, depending on your setup)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL database server

### Setup

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nesmussa/To-do-list-web.git
cd To-do-list-web
```
````

**2. Install dependencies:**

You will need to install dependencies for both the backend and the frontend.

```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend/ # Or your backend directory name (e.g., crud-nestjs)
npm install # or yarn install
cd ../ # Go back to the project root

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend/ # Or your frontend directory name (e.g., front_end)
npm install # or yarn install
cd ../ # Go back to the project root
```

**3. Configure Environment Variables:**

**Backend:**
Create a `.env` file in the root of the backend directory (`./backend/`) and add your PostgreSQL database connection details:

```dotenv
# .env for Backend
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432 # or your PostgreSQL port
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name
```

**Frontend:**
Create a `.env` file in the root of the frontend directory (`./frontend/` or `./front_end/`) and add the backend API URL. Remember the `VITE_` prefix for Vite:

```dotenv
# .env for Frontend
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000 # Match your backend port
```

**4. Compile and Run the Project:**

Start both the backend and the frontend development servers.

```bash
# Start the backend (in the backend directory)
cd backend/
npm dev # or yarn start:dev
```

The backend should be running at `http://localhost:4000`.

```bash
# Start the frontend (in the frontend directory)
cd frontend/ # Or your frontend directory name (e.g., front_end)
npm run dev # or yarn dev
```

The frontend application should be running at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port indicated by Vite).

## Run Tests (Backend)

If you have implemented tests for your NestJS backend, you can run them using the following commands from the backend directory:

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## API Endpoints

The backend provides the following RESTful API endpoints:

- `GET /crud`: Get all tasks.
- `GET /crud/:id`: Get a single task by ID.
- `POST /crud`: Create a new task. Expects task data in the request body.
- `PATCH /crud/:id`: Update an existing task by ID. Expects updated task data in the request body.
- `DELETE /crud/:id`: Delete a task by ID.

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
